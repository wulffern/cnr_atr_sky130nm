A standard transistor library

The naming convention is NCH/PCH for NMOS and PMOS.


The width is set by the number of contacts (12C)

The length is a multiplum of minimum (1f2)

So a transistor called NCH_12C12fF0 is a NMOS with 12 contacts on drain/source
and a 12x minimum gate length.

While a transistor called "PCH_2C1F2" is a PMOS with 2 contacts and 1.2x minimum
gate length.
